- **Hooks**: Utilized React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext` to manage component lifecycle and state.

## Data Management Approach

Context API and Local Storage: The Context API is used for centralized state management, including cart and favorite items. Local Storage is used for persisting favorite items, so they remain available even after page reloads.
